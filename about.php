        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
        <p >60,000 New Zealanders suffer from dementia. Currently, one in five LANDSAR searches for lost individuals involve an elderly patient suffering from dementia. The current projections suggest that in 2050, 
        170,000 people will suffer from the illness. Devota not only sees this as a safety issue, but a massive opportunity to do good in a world made especially challenging for our elderly. We want to bring back 
        the independence and freedom which the elderly so dearly desire as they reach their golden years. With our revolutionary beacon, the elderly suffering from dementia can venture out of locked doors. There             is a massive market for a product of this capability, and here at Devota, we truly believe we can fill this gap. If we're able to take away the stress, the worry, or even make a caregiver's day that little
        bit easier, it's worth it for us. </p>
